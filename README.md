## What is Spallet
Spallet is a community wallet developed for the Phantasma Blockchain. The name is a playful blend of Sparky, Specky (mostly Sparky), and Wallet—resulting in Spallet. I aimed for a catchy and fun name for this wallet.

With Spallet, I want to inject some fun and creativity into the world of crypto wallets by reflecting a gaming-oriented chain with small animations, humor, and more. Although I am not a highly experienced developer, my goal is to create a wallet that is engaging and enjoyable to use.

I developed Spallet partly because I don't like Poltergeist's design and particularly dislike seeing that guy's name still on its license. I hope Spallet can help foster a new culture within the Phantasma community—who knows what we might achieve, right?
